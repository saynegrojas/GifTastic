Giphy project

In this assignment, I use the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of anime as a category. I call the GIPHY API and use JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of my site.
Click on a button with a topic. Then populates the page with 10 gifs from the GIPHY API. Initially, the gifs taken from the GIPHY API are still images. Once pressed on a gif, the gif then animates. Pressed again, it will stop the animation. 
The search form is given to provide the user to input an "anime" of thier choice and gets pushed in the array, as well as a button created.
